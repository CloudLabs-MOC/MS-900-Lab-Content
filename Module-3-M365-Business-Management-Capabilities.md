# Module 3: M365 Business Management Capabilities 

 In this module, you will learn to work with M365 groups, Microsoft Planner, Forms, Power BI. You will also explore through Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

#  Types of Groups in M365 

1. In the Groups section of the Microsoft 365 admin center, you can create and manage different types of groups:

   - **Microsoft 365 group**:  Microsoft 365 groups are used for collaboration between users, both inside and outside your company. With each Microsoft 365 group, members get a group email and shared workspace for conversations, files, and calendar events, and a Planner.
   
   - **Distribution**: Distribution groups are used for sending notifications to a group of people. They can receive an external email if enabled by the administrator.
   Distribution groups are best for situations where you need to broadcast information to a set group of people.
   
   - **mail-enabled security**: These groups are used for granting access to resources such as SharePoint, and emailing notifications to those users.
   
   - **Security groups**: They can be used for granting access to resources such as SharePoint sites. They can make administration easier because you need to only administer the group rather than adding users to each resource individually.
